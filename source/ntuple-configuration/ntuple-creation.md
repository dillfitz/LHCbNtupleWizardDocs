# Creating an Ntuple Object

When you are satisfied with your selection of physics process, stripping line, and dataset, you can proceed with configuring the output Ntuple to contain desired quantities related to candidates of the physics process or collision event in which it occured. First, a configurable object representing the Ntuple must be added to the row(s) on the main page by clicking the green "+" button located directly above the rendered equation representing the physics process, as shown in the figure below.

It is then necessary to provide a name for the Ntuple, allowing for configuration of the newly created Ntuple, as shown below.

Clicking on the edit pad button will launch a new page where the Ntuple can be configured interactively. In the case the user has selected multiple physics processes for analysis, the Ntuples can be configured simultaneously. Once both Ntuples have been added, and named, the edit pad button at the bottom of the screen will be available to click, as shown in the screenshow below.
