Once the submit button is clicked, a popup window will appear prompting input for a reason the request was made, as shown below. This information will help the LHCb Open Data team assess request priority given the available computing resources. Once a reason for the request is provided, the user can click the blue "Submit request" button, and the query will be sent to the LHCb open data team for processing.
