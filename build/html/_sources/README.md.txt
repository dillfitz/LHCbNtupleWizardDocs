# The LHCb Ntuple Wizard

Welcome to the Ntuple Wizard Documentation!

The Ntuple Wizard is an application allowing users to interface with LHCb open data [Comput.Softw.Big Sci. 7 (2023) 1, 6](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2637214). Users can generate a query by following steps laid out in this tutorial, which will be processed by the LHCb Open Data team, and if accepted, ultimately will result in Ntuples delivered to the [CERN Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cern.ch/). The application is also hosted on the Open Data Portal with the landing page shown in the screenshot below. The procedure to formulate a query of the LHCb data can be initiated by clicking the green "Create new request" button.

It is recommended to use the Ntuple Wizard in a computer browser rather than on a mobile phone, as there is important contextual information displayed in mouseover tooltips that may not be accessible on mobile devices.
